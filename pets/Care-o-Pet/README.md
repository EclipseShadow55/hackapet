## Customization
### Changing Pet
1. Replace any sprite in PNGs with your own pet sprites, making sure to keep the EXACT SAME NAMES
   1. I recommend using [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) to create your sprites
   2. Make sure to export your sprites as Sprite-Sheet PNGs
   3. Pick a dimension that is a multiple of 128x128 for the best results
   4. Make sure to keep the same dimensions for all of the pet sprites
2. Run `setup.py` to convert the sprites to the correct format
3.
